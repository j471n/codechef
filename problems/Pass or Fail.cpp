// The test has a total of N

//  marks for a correct answer and âˆ’1
//  for an incorrect answer. Chef is a risk-averse person so he decided to attempt all the questions. It is known that Chef got X
//  questions correct and the rest of them incorrect. For Chef to pass the course he must score at least P
//  marks.
